<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Sarah</h1>
<h3 align="center">Aspiring Developer and Lifelong Learner with a Background in Education</h3>

🎓 I’m currently working on [BSCS from Western Governors University](https://github.com/sngillard/WGU_Transfer_Courses.git)

👩🏻‍💻 I've completed several [SheCodes Coding Workshops](https://www.shecodes.io/graduates/43613-sarah-gillard)

I’m pursuing a Computer Science degree at WGU, set to graduate in 2025. My background includes degrees in Psychology and Education. I hold a teaching license for grades 1-6 and currently substitute teach while I study. 

According to Myers-Briggs, I’m an INFP, so like many INFPs, I love sunsets and enjoy capturing nature through photography (novice photographer). My empathetic nature drives me to ensure that my work is both user-centered and meaningful. I am committed to contributing effectively to all aspects of a project, understanding that every task plays a crucial role in achieving overall success.

My top 5 CliftonStrengths are Realtor, Learner, Input, Responsibility, and Adaptability. I enjoy learning new things and exploring new ideas.

I’m not a fan of having social media—even LinkedIn began to feel a bit too social-media-ish for me—so I use this GitHub profile to showcase my projects and keep my resume updated.

Thanks for checking it out!
