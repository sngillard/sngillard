<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Sarah</h1>
<h2 align="center">Aspiring Developer and Lifelong Learner with a Background in Education</h2>

<p style="font-size: 1.5em;"> <strong>
  🎓 I’m currently working on <a href="https://github.com/sngillard/WGU_Transfer_Courses.git" target="_blank">BSCS from Western Governors University</a>
</strong></p>

<p style="font-size: 1.5em;"> <strong>
  👩🏻‍💻 I've completed several <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/graduates/43613-sarah-gillard" target="_blank">SheCodes Coding Workshops</a> </strong>
</p>


I’m pursuing a Computer Science degree at WGU, set to graduate in 2025. My background includes degrees in Psychology and Education, and I hold a teaching license for grades 1-6. Currently, I substitute teach while I study.

Like many with ADHD, I’ve explored various career paths, but programming has really captured my interest. I find it engaging because it offers the chance to solve problems and be creative in different ways. It feels like a field where my strengths align nicely.

As a geek into personality types, I know I’m an INFP—like many INFPs, I love taking photos of sunsets and have an empathetic personality. My Enneagram type is 6w5, which means I also have an analytical side. My top CliftonStrengths—Realtor, Learner, Input, Responsibility, and Adaptability—reflect my passion for learning and exploring new ideas.

I’m not a fan of social media—even LinkedIn began to feel a bit too social-media-ish for me—so I use this GitHub profile to showcase my projects and introduce myself to potential recruiters who might find it through my resume.

Thanks for checking it out!
